# Sample Trading Algorithm Project

This repo contains code and data for an example trading algorithm. The algorithm uses a triple-first-differences time-weighted approach to estimate windows for buying and selling options. 

`compare_models.py` runs the models and shows relevant stats for the output.
`export_data.py` will generate time series returns of the predictions.
